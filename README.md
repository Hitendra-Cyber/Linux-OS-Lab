#  DESCRIPTION:
#  This repository contains my Operating System Lab programs
#  implemented in the C language. The programs can be compiled
#  and executed on both Linux and Windows environments.
#
#  Each program simulates a key OS concept such as:
#   - CPU Scheduling
#   - Memory Management
#   - File Allocation
#   - Deadlock Avoidance
#   - Disk Scheduling
#   - Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#  CONTENTS:
#   1. CPU Scheduling Algorithms
#       → FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority
#   2. File Allocation Strategies
#       → Sequential, Indexed, Linked
#   3. Multi-Level Queue Scheduling
#       → System vs User process queues
#   4. Memory Management
#       → MVT & MFT techniques
#   5. Contiguous Memory Allocation
#       → First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit
#   6. Banker’s Algorithm
#       → Deadlock Avoidance
#   7. Disk Scheduling
#       → FCFS, SSTF
#   8. Producer-Consumer Problem
#       → Using Semaphores (without pthread)
#   9. Dining Philosophers Problem
#       → Classic synchronization example
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#  HOW TO COMPILE (for both OS):
#
#   ▶ On Linux / Mac:
#       gcc filename.c -o output
#       ./output
#
#   ▶ On Windows (using MinGW or Code::Blocks):
#       gcc filename.c -o output.exe
#       output.exe
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#  LEARNING GOALS:
#   - Understand core OS algorithms and mechanisms.
#   - Learn process, memory, and file management concepts.
#   - Strengthen C programming and logic building.
#   - Practice Git and GitHub workflow for version control.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#  FUTURE UPGRADES:
#   - Add real-time visual demos for scheduling algorithms.
#   - Include more IPC and synchronization examples.
#   - Add short theory PDFs for each topic.
